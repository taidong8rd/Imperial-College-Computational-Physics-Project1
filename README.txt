The Python codes are best run in Spyder. Put the data.csv in the same directory as the codes.

The parabolic_univariate.py covers Task 3.1 - 4.1, including the 1D parabolic minimiser and the 2D univariate method.

Other .py files cover Task 4.2 (2D Newton's method) and Task 5 (3D Newton's method) as their names suggest.
The files labeled with '_byhand' indicates that the expressions of the many derivatives used in it were derived by 
hands. Run these files as they run faster and are provided with comments to explain. By contrast, the files not
labelled with '_byhand' use 'sympy' package to manipulate the derivatives automatically. They share the same
logics and produce the same results as their counterparts but run much more slowly. They are to illustrate the 
author's efforts only.

Each file has been divided into several cells to separate the functions defined and the inplementing and plotting codes.
Run the cells from top to bottom.

Thanks.
